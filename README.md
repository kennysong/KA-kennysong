============

My project-based interview (JS) for Khan Academy's 2015 summer internship. 

Uses Esprima and Estraverse to parse code, CodeMirror for nice formatting, and web workers to make it fast. Runs on Express on Heroku â€“ live at http://ka.kennysong.com.

(Some artistic license was taken with the original prompt.)
